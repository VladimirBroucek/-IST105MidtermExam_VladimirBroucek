                        <span>The first thing that struck me about Vancouver is how many foreigners
                            there are and the second thing that struck me and is very different is the
                            traditional food at Christmas (dinner). In the Czech Republic it is customary
                            to have fish or schnitzel with potato salad for dinner, but here it is turkey. </span>

                        <span>What I really miss the most is our traditional Czech pastries like bread and rolls.
                            I don't know too many countries where they sell rolls in the shops,
                            but in the Czech Republic it is everywhere. The second thing I miss is Czech beer.
                            The Czech Republic is famous for producing excellent beer.</span>

                        <span>What I really like about Canada and Vancouver is the beautiful nature.
                            As an active person who likes to spend time outdoors, I really like the nature here.
                            I haven't had a chance to explore everything yet,
                            but Queen Elizabeth Park, for example, is really beautiful </span>
